# The Cost of Experience

“One day you come home and realize that you locked yourself out of your home.

You call the locksmith.

He arrives, looks at the door, fiddles with the lock for one minute, opens the door then leaves.

The next day you receive the bill, $150.

Are you mad for spending so much for one minute of work?

You shouldn’t: you paid for the experience that allowed him to open it in 1 minute.”

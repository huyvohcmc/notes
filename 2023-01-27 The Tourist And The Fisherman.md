# 27.01.2023 - The Tourist And The Fisherman

A tourist focuses in on a most idyllic picture: a man in simple clothes, dozing in a small fishing boat that's been pulled out of the waves rolling up the sandy beach.

The camera clicks, the man awakens. The tourist offers him a cigarette and launches into a conversation: 'The weather's great, there's plenty of fish; so why are you lying around here instead of going out and catching more?'

The fisherman replies: 'Because I caught enough this morning.'

'But just imagine!' the tourist says, 'You could go out three or four times a day, bringing home three or four times as much fish! You know what could happen??'

The fisherman quietly shakes his head.

'After about a year, you could buy yourself a motorboat!' says the tourist. 'After two years you could buy a second one! And after three years, you could have a cutter or two - and just think! One day, you might be able to build a freezing plant, or a smoke house; you might eventually even get your own helicopter to guide your fleet in tracing shoals of fish; or you could buy your own trucks, to ship your fish to the capital - and then -'

'...And then?' asks the fisherman.

'And then!' the tourist continues triumphantly, 'You could be sitting on the beach, dozing in the Sun and looking at the beautiful ocean!'
